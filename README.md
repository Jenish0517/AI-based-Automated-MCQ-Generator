# AI-based-Automated-MCQ-Generator
 Created a Flask web application based on AI (Gemini API) to create MCQs  from user subjects or uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT). Provides  teacher and student modules with session key-based quiz access and  result tracking. This invention is mainly for educational purpose. 
📘 AI-Based Automated MCQ Generator

Generate high-quality multiple-choice questions automatically from text, PDFs, and study materials.

## 📝 Project Overview

The AI-Based MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Generator is a smart system that automatically generates MCQs from:

Paragraphs or plain text

PDF files

Notes or study material

Subject chapters

Any uploaded document

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) or AI models to create meaningful questions along with multiple answer options. This helps automate the process of assessment, learning, and test creation.

##🎯 Purpose of the Project

The primary use of the MCQ Generator is to reduce manual effort in creating questions and to provide a quick and efficient tool for teachers, students, and training institutions.

##🚀 Key Features

📄 Generate MCQs from text (copy & paste and get questions instantly)

📘 Generate MCQs from PDFs

🎚️ Question difficulty control (Easy, Medium, Hard — optional)

🔍 Automatic answer key generation

🔄 Randomized option generation

🧠 AI/NLP-driven question formation

💾 Download MCQs (PDF / TXT) (optional feature)

🌐 Web-based interface (Flask/Java/Node depending on your project)
